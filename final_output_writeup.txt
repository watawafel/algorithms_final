COMMENTS IN REGARD TO CODE 
####################################################################

As this assignment was very similar to homework 9, I decided to reuse the code and modify as needed. The dataset was imported using the code provided from the web site where the database was found, it might have been slower, because of decompression, it took an hour to pull in, but I wanted to see how long it would take while I worked on tests for the actual problem. 

After decompression, the data was imported into a pandas database. Which was as the previous assignment then represented as an adjacency graph matrix. Because the rows/columns were quite large, and the “asin” object was represented alphanumerically. I re-represented each item as a smaller unique value that could be reindexed if necessary. Though, for this assignment it was not. Then I could use the same operation “connected_components” on the csgraph. I did it with strong and weak connection with expected equal output (1 connected component) because graph is undirected.

The functions returning reviews given a product ID or reviewer ID, was simply iterating and indexing all rows in specified column for requested values, each function O(n) operation to search for specified input. 

Returning data in ascending order, required a “sort_values” function with the specified column to be sorted on a subset (columns including : “reviewerID”, “asin”) original database. Even though the data seemed to already be sorted by “asin”, it was sorted anyway just in case, and index values maintained by rows within subset of database (“subsetdf”), from this, positions of the rows in sorted subset, not indexes, could be referenced against the original database to provide the requested information.

ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS NEEDING FURTHER RESPONSE

Would a greedy algorithm work for finding the minimum number of
colors to color this graph? If so, how, if not why not? No coding
needed. Also, what is the minimum number of colors needed to do
the coloring? 

Yes, a greedy algorithm could potentially work to find the minimum number of colors, however it would return an approximation of the chromatic number. However; not with certainty of the exact value. The minimum number (chromatic number) of colors to do the coloring are the integer value of the maximum degree in the vertex plus one if a complete/bipartite graph. Since this is not a complete/odd-cycle graph. The number of colors is at minimum the maximum degree of a vertex within the graph, which in this case is 4915.


Does the graph have any cycle of length 7? Hint: Don’t code for
this.

Note: If it had an odd length cycle, the chromatic number would be the max degree + 1.

No it does not. Products do not have direct edges between products, as reviewers do not have directed edges between reviewers. They have to use intermediaries such as: product -> reviewer -> product and/or reviewer -> product -> reviewer. And since 7 is an odd cycle, there would not be a cycle of length 7. You can only have even cycles.
